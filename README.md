#### Description
Aliases are basically just functions for your terminal. In simple terms  
they are commands use to replace a command or a set of commands.  
A bunch of fish aliases (functions) for my everyday tasks (workspace)


#### Setup
1. Create a `.config` directory in your `user` directory if it does not exist.
2. Create `fish` directory in the `.config` directory if does not exist.
3. Clone this repo into the `fish` directory.
4. Enjoy your aliases!


```bash
mkdir ~/.config
mkdir ~/.config/fish
git clone https://github.com/kali-physi-hacker/fish-alias.git functions
```


### Note:  
These aliases are specific to my work space and my use cases.
In general, you can modify to suite your use or even add more aliases (functions).
